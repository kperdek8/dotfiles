Background="Wallpaper.png"

DimBackgroundImage="0.0"

ScaleImageCropped="true"

ScreenWidth="1920"
ScreenHeight="1080"

## [Blur Settings]

FullBlur="false"
PartialBlur="true"
## Enable or disable the blur effect; if HaveFormBackground is set to true then PartialBlur will trigger the BackgroundColor of the form element to be partially transparent and blend with the blur.

BlurRadius="5"

## [Design Customizations]

HaveFormBackground="false"
## Have a full opacity background color behind the form that takes slightly more than 1/3 of screen estate;  if PartialBlur is set to true then HaveFormBackground will trigger the BackgroundColor of the form element to be partially transparent and blend with the blur.

FormPosition="left"
## Position of the form which takes roughly 1/3 of screen estate. Can be left, center or right.

BackgroundImageHAlignment="center"
## Horizontal position of the background picture relative to its visible area. Applies when ScaleImageCropped is set to false or when HaveFormBackground is set to true and FormPosition is either left or right. Can be left, center or right; defaults to center if none is passed.

BackgroundImageVAlignment="center"
## As before but for the vertical position of the background picture relative to its visible area.

MainColor="#f8f8f2"
## Used for all elements when not focused/hovered etc. Usually the best effect is achieved by having this be either white or a very dark grey like #444 (not black for smoother antialias)
## Colors can be HEX or Qt names (e.g. red/salmon/blanchedalmond). See https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-color.html

AccentColor="#ffffff"
## Used for elements in focus/hover/pressed. Should be contrasting to the background and the MainColor to achieve the best effect.

BackgroundColor="#21222C"
## Used for the user and session selection background as well as for ScreenPadding and FormBackground when either is true. If PartialBlur and FormBackground are both enabled this color will blend with the blur effect.

placeholderColor="#bbbbbb"
## Placholder text color. Example: username, password.

IconColor="#ffffff"
## System icon colors

OverrideLoginButtonTextColor=""
## The text of the login button may become difficult to read depending on your color choices. Use this option to set it independently for legibility.

InterfaceShadowSize="6"
## Integer used as multiplier. Size of the shadow behind the user and session selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background. Initial render can be slow no values above 5-7.

InterfaceShadowOpacity="0.6"
## Double between 0 and 1. Alpha channel of the shadow behind the user and session selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background.

RoundCorners="20"
## Integer in pixels. Radius of the input fields and the login button. Empty for square. Can cause bad antialiasing of the fields.

ScreenPadding="0"
## Integer in pixels. Increase or delete this to have a padding of color BackgroundColor all around your screen. This makes your login greeter appear as if it was a canvas. Cool!

Font="Noto Sans"
## If you want to choose a custom font it will have to be available to the X root user. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fonts#Manual_installation

FontSize=""
## Only set a fixed value if fonts are way too small for your resolution. Preferrably kept empty.

HideLoginButton="true"
## Hides login button if set to true.

ForceHideVirtualKeyboardButton="true"
